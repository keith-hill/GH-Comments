# overview

html content for the overview is pulled directly from the **overview** post.
- https://forum.metastock.com/posts/t155735-overview

sessions
- https://forum.metastock.com/topics/756-sessions

each session is a post in the **sessions** folder.

post titles need to be formated exactly this way:

> SESSION TITLE - PRESENTER NAME - TIME

for example:

> Q&A Session - Jeff Gibby - 5:00 PM EST

the post contents needs to have this format (click Source in post editor for html):

<div rel="presenter-200px.jpg">

    <p>Bla bla bla... any forum-safe html can go here.</p>

</div>
