  <p>What is “Hidden Momentum?” "Momentum" is an empirically defined measure and hence should be clearly measurable and
    visible. How then can momentum be hidden? How do you measure it? Where do you look for it? Like most things about
    financial markets, the true secrets are only revealed when you know how to peel back the layers of the onion. These
    questions will be answered in this session.&nbsp; As well, all attendees will receive an exclusive bonus
    "Exploration" to scan a portfolio easily and quickly for opportunities using MetaStock.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
