  <p>Candlestick patterns are graphical depictions of human emotions in action. These patterns confirm the consistency
    of human nature. This is what makes them so powerful. In trading, youâ€™re not forced to rely on some arcane,
    complicated mathematical analysis. Instead, you can focus on a handful of patterns that are extremely easy to
    identify visually on your charts. In this one-hour presentation, Steve will show you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The three basic elements that define the Doji Sandwich setup&nbsp;</li>
    <li>How to calculate your third-day profit of this three-day pattern</li>
    <li>Why this powerful pattern will work on any chart... from the one-minute chart to the monthly</li>
    <li>How to profit from the "Doji Secret"... the one simple "high probability" element</li>
    <li>How to anticipate even greater gains with the "McMuffin Pattern" - a very common and high-probability reversal
      signal that usually leads to "mouth-watering" profits</li>
