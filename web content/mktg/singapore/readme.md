## overview

html content for the overview is pulled directly from the overview post.

## sessions

each session is a post in the session forum

post titles need to be formated exactly this way:

***SESSION TITLE - PRESENTER NAME - TIME***

for example:

***Q&A Session - Jeff Gibby - 5:00 PM EST***

the post contents needs to have this format (click Source in post editor for html):

```
<div rel="presenter-200px.jpg">

    <p>Bla bla bla... any forum-safe html can go here.</p>

</div>
```
